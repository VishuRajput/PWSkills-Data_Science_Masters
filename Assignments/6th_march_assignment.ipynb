The mean is sensitive to extreme values and provides a balanced estimate when the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It represents the value(s) that appear(s) with the highest frequency. The mode is useful for categorical or discrete data, but it can also be used with continuous data. It helps identify the most common category or value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread of the data. However, it is highly influenced by extreme values and may not capture the overall variability well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the average deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the dispersion or spread of the data. A larger standard deviation indicates greater variability, while a smaller standard deviation suggests less variability. It is commonly used with the mean to describe the spread of normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variance: The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean. It is another measure of data spread similar to the standard deviation. The variance is useful for understanding the dispersion of the data, but its value is in squared units, which can make interpretation more challenging compared to the standard deviation.\n"
